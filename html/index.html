      <h2>Working on my way</h2>
      <p>Born in Dominican Republic, Santo Domingo. When I was a children I was always told that I can be a civil engineer or arquitech because I was good at drawing. When I enrolled in
        university I understand that I didn't have a good math base, so studying civil engineer was going to take me longer than it should be, I changed to industrial design, a career that
        didn't even know existed. I didn't have much of a guidence growing up, I was raise to be a good person but without a concrete purpose or how important it was to be stable in the future. 
        Now days I have to find my self and work to not fall behind.
        <br><br>
      As an student back in 2011:<br>
      <ul>
      <ol>My favorite part during university was 3d modeling, althought this aspect wasn't explore deep enough.</ol>  
      <ol>I'm was good at drawing since I was child, so most of the courses relating drawing and digital drawing were easy for me.</ol>
      </ul>

              <td rowspan="2"><p>Both projects were complete during my years as student, the first one in 2013, was a concept for a toiler for people with back issues or elders,
              one of my team members thought it would take us too much time to complete a better option to present, so we went with a version in my opinion, bad, but anyways I was able 
              to practice more about curving in SolidWorks, which is the software that I use most of the time.</p>
              <p>The second project was a blindcane (smart cane), that have a sensor to dectect areas that the usual cane can't, allowing blind people to feel more safe while walking.</p>
              <p>In my first presentation for this project I got nervous and couldn't continue, it was infront of a lot of people, it was really embarrasing, so I decided with my group 
                for the last presentation to not be presented, as it wasn't really required. I was happy with the result of my model, but the person we hired to do the wiring, and the sensor 
                function did a bad job, making our project difficult to present, some of my members cried but I was just relieve it ended. I never thought the project have any future.
              </p>
              <p>A project that I really enjoyed was at <a href="https://inica.com.do/"target="_blank">INICA</a> , there I did an air conditioning grille, basically the first one in the country, simple but, it 
              felt like a real thing, with a real purpose compare to all the things I did in university, and that I saw other classmates doing. Some of my work at INICA can been seen at the
