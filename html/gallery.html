                my family was also protective but I'm glad they did because I like they way I have become. Since I couldn't go out and my sister was 14 years older than me, 
                I didn't have much things to do, so I used to play with clay, drawing and plants in my backyard.<br><br> I developed very good skills for manual work, although I have 
                never study properly how to do it profesionally. Maybe I should do it and and earn some extra money with it. Coming to Canada made me realize I will an extra way of
                 income if I want to keep snowbowling my progression. <br><br> For the rest of this pages, I'll be showing the rest of my work, specially the air conditioning grille, 
                 which I developed along with triangular grilles.<br><br><p>The list of softwares that I use for my digital work are:</p><ul><li>Adobe Photoshop</li><li>Adobe Illustrator</ol>
